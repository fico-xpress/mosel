   Mosel Testing Examples
   ======================

   file myexampletest.mos
   ``````````````````````
   Demonstrating the use of basic testing system commands

   Command to run this model through the Mosel Testing System
   (assuming both files are in the same location):

     mosel moseltest SRCDIR=myexampletest.mos

   Keeping the working directory (by default a log file is produced
   only in case of errors):

     mosel moseltest SRCDIR=myexampletest.mos KEEPDIR=true

model "my test example"
 options keepassert

 function dosomething(a: integer): integer
  returned:=2*a
  writeln("f(x)=", returned)
 end-function

 ! Various ways of calling the routine that is to be tested
 res:=dosomething(0)
 asproc(dosomething(-5))

 ! Mosel's 'assert' can be used within the testing system, remember to
 ! specify the option 'keepassert' in this case
 assert(dosomething(10)=20, "Expected value "+20)

 ! This causes an error (model result status value: RT_MATHERR=3)
 setmatherr("Math error test")
